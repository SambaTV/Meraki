# Username field

  The username field is Hard-coded(once configured, can not be changed) when a new user is saved. 
    -> the username is pushed to a machine when a user is bound to a system 

  NOTE 
  If username field of existing account on a previous workstation matches the username field on JC
    -> the agent will take over the account and it will be manageable from JC admin console

  Mismatch = BAD
    ex) steve.jobs vs sjobs


#User email

  Can be updated after account is created

  Office 365 or G Suite?
    -> Directory sync feature
      (Allows JC to view password authority for only accounts admin specifies)
      
      How to leverage Directory Sync Feature?
        1. Authorize the directory sync
          (this is done in the Directories Tab)
        2. Once authorized, import users in bulk directly through this integration
          * additional info ( support.jumpCloud.com )
