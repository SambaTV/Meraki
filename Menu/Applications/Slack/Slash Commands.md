# Slash Commands 

## Info
Slash Commands are initiated from the message box in Slack.
Once part of an app, they can easily be installed for your workspace as an internal integration or shared with the world, distributed to other work spaces via the App Directory.

## Structure
* A user in Slack types in the message box with the command, and submits it.
* A data payload is sent via an HTTP POST request to the URL configured for that command in your app.
* The app responds in some way.

1. Creating a slash command
