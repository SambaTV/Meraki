Write a Powershell script that conditionally updates user information in Active Directory from a RESTful API call to BambooHR.

The script should do the following:

1. Connect to BambooHR via the API and download employee information
2. Iterate through the results and update the associated users in Active Directory
3. The following fields should be updated based on EmployeeID:
  a. FirstName
  b. LastName
  c. PreferredFirstName (takes precedence over First Name)
  d. DisplayName
  e. Department
  f. Manager (will need to lookup Manager in AD based on EmployeeID)
4. Also add in the condition to only update the Active Directory user if a value has changed in BambooHR.

Use Powershell scripting best practice to include:
  a. Error checking
  b. Data validation
  c. Logging
  d. Documenting comments.  

Invoke-RestMethod should be used to make the API call, and the script should not save to a temporary local file.
