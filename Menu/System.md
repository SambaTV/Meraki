# Add a system

  ## To bind a system to JumpCloud
   1. Install JC agent on system
        (JC Agent is an app that runs in the background as a process of Windows, Mac, and Linux)
        (JC Agent- checks into the cloud at a 60 sec interval, using an encrypted connection, whenever it has an active        internet connection vs traditional directory- machine checks into an authoitative controller only when it's on the corporate    network)
   2. Click the plus in the Systems tab
    -> Here you will find install steps for each system that is compatible with JC Platform
      -> During the install process you will be asked to provide your connect key
        (Connect Key is the unique identifier that binds your machine to the JC Console)
